# Star Trek Spelling Game

A child friendly console game, using many well known character names
from the Star Trek universe.

## Game modes

There is two modes for the game.

- Easy -
  The game shows characters full names, before the test
  starts. This is best for younger children who are likely
  not to remember/need to help.
- Normal -
  The game hides characters first names with asterisks. Some
  Star Trek character knowledge is therefore necessary.

To start in a game mode on execution you may add a command line argument
to the path when you execute the .jar file. E.g.

`java -jar starTrekSpelling.jar <Game mode [easy, hard]>`
